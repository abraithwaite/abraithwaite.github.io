I am a Software Engineer who particularly enjoys building highly scalable
applications on top of distributed systems.  I write code and sometimes I post
it to [github](https://github.com/abraithwaite).

At Cloudflare, I played a key role in scaling the data pipeline from 1.5M
events per second to over 8M events per second using Kafka, Golang and various
databases.

Now I'm at Segment helping build out the data infrastructure.
