I'm not great at writing, but I really feel like I should make more of an effort
to share my experiences online for anyone to read, even if nobody does.
I've learned a lot from random blog posts on the internet and feel that this is
the least I can do to try to give back.

The title of the post is from one of my favorite book series because this is not
the first time I've tried to maintain a blog.  I think an alternative strategy
I'll use this time is not trying to get into detail in my posts unless I feel like
it.  We'll see if that works.
